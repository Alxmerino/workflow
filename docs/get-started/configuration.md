# Configuration

Create an `workflow.php` file under your `/config` directory with the following options available to you. You can also use multi-environment options to change these per environment.

```php
<?php

return [
    '*' => [
        'enabledSections' => '*',
        'editorUserGroup' => '',
        'publisherUserGroup' => '',
        'editorNotifications' => true,
        'publisherNotifications' => true,
        'selectedPublishers' => '*',
    ]
];
```

- `editorNotifications` - Whether editors should receive email notifications.
