# Roadmap

Below is a list of upcoming features to Workflow.

- Entry diffs to compare previous and submitted entries.
- Setting specific recipients for Publisher notifications - rather than entire Publisher group.
- Better note-tracking per-version
- Incorporate versions - tie each submission to a version

Have a suggestion? We'd love to hear about it! [Make a suggestion](/craft-plugins/workflow/support)
