# Workflow
Workflow is a Craft CMS plugin to create a better workflow for publishing entries. Includes email/control panel notifications to moderation users/groups.

A common scenario might involve certain users who are content editors/creators, but don't have the permission to publish particular entries. Instead, once an entry is ready to be published, the user can submit it for review. An entry moderator will be notified of any pending entries through email (and the control panel) where they can action the entry.
