# Workflow

Workflow is a Craft CMS plugin for a common publisher-editor scenario when it comes to content authoring.

A common scenario might involve certain users who are content editors/creators, but don't have the permission to publish particular entries. Instead, once an entry is ready to be published, the user can submit it for review. An entry moderator will be notified of any pending entries through email (and the control panel) where they can action the entry.


## Features

- Makes use of Craft's native user permissions.
- Choose which user groups are your Editor and Publisher roles.
- Email notifications to Publisher group, which editable content.
- Events for third-party plugins to hook into for submissions.


## Documentation

Please visit the [Wiki](https://github.com/engram-design/Workflow/wiki) for all documentation, a getting started guide, template tags, and developer resources.


## Roadmap
- Entry diffs to compare previous and submitted entries.
- Setting specific (non Craft user) recipients for Publisher notifications.
